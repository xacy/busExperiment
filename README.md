## Todo

* Make recent clickables
* Local storage recent queries
* Cors it's a problem, i can't make external calls without proxying through an external website
and that's a no go.
* Do the other points in the list and research a little more to see it can be circunvented.
if not mark it as finished. 



## Done
* ~~Do a basic query with vue-resource an do a preliminary parsing of the web.~~
* ~~Info component~~
* ~~Seems like instead of using http.get it's better to use axios. Integrate it.~~
* ~~Queries debug~~
* ~~Basic layout with an ui framework~~
* ~~Recent components~~
